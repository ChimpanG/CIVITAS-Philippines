			<Text>María Corazón 'Cory' Cojuangco Aquino was a Filipino politician who served as the 11th President of the Philippines, becoming the first woman to hold that office. Corazon Aquino was the most prominent figure of the 1986 People Power Revolution, which ended the 21-year rule of President Ferdinand Marcos. She was named Time magazine's Woman of the Year in 1986. Prior to this, she had not held any elective office.</Text>

			<Text>A self-proclaimed 'plain housewife', she was married to Senator Benigno Aquino Jr., the staunchest critic of President Marcos. She emerged as leader of the opposition after her husband was assassinated on 21 August 1983 upon returning to the Philippines from exile in the United States. In late 1985, Marcos called for snap elections, and Aquino ran for president with former senator Salvador Laurel as her running mate for vice president. After the elections were held on 7 February 1986, the Batasang Pambansa proclaimed Marcos and his running mate Arturo Tolentino as the winners; allegations were made of electoral fraud, with Aquino calling for massive civil disobedience actions. Defections from the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the support of the local Catholic hierarchy led to the People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos and secured Aquino's accession on 25 February 1986.</Text>

			<Text>As President, Aquino oversaw the promulgation of the 1987 Constitution, which limited the powers of the Presidency and re-established the bicameral Congress. Her administration provided strong emphasis on and concern for civil liberties and human rights, and on peace talks to resolve the ongoing Communist insurgency and Islamist secession movements. Her economic policies centered on restoring economic health and confidence and focused on creating a market-oriented and socially responsible economy. In 1987, she became the first Filipino to be bestowed with the prestigious Prize For Freedom Award.</Text>

			<Text>Several coup attempts were made against Aquino's government; it also faced various natural calamities until the end of her term in 1992. She was succeeded as President by Fidel Ramos, and returned to civilian life while remaining public about her opinions on political issues. In recognition for her role in the world's most peaceful revolution to attain democracy, she was awarded the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1998.</Text>

			<Text>As the guiding light of the People Power Revolution, Corazon Aquino is fondly remembered and deeply revered by most Filipinos as the 'mother of Philippine democracy', and the 'housewife who led a revolution'. She has been hailed by American columnist Georgie Anne Geyer as a modern-day Joan of Arc.</Text>

			<Text>While nominally a late bloomer, Corazon can hit the ground running with an extra wildcard in place of a military policy slot in any government. To make the most out of her ability to gain 3 times as much tourism from Great Works, she will likely use this wildcard slot to boost her points towards great writers, artists and later, musicians. The culture that great works inherently provide should help her race through the civic tree to unlock naturalist units sooner than others, which she will then use to boost her economy through national parks and wrap up a cultural victory.</Text>
